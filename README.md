Code for Robocorp Certificate level II: Build a robot

Before you start, change the following file:
devdata/env.json

{
  "RPA_SECRET_MANAGER": "RPA.Robocorp.Vault.FileSecrets",
  "RPA_SECRET_FILE": "/path/to/robot/resources/vault.json"
}

vault.json can be found from the resources/ -folder, but you have to change the "path/to/robot/" to match your environment where you downloaded the robot code
